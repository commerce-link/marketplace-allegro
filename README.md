# marketplace-allegro

Allegro marketplace integration for the CommerceLink platform. Implements `MarketplaceProvider`
(`marketplace-api:0.2.2`), discovered via SPI. Scope: import of paid orders only + order
lifecycle (accept/ship/cancel). Offer export and invoices — stage 2.

## How the "paid only" import works

Checkout forms are fetched with `status=READY_FOR_PROCESSING` (per Allegro documentation:
"payment completed") and `fulfillment.status=NEW`. Additionally, for prepaid payment types
(ONLINE, WIRE_TRANSFER, SPLIT_PAYMENT, EXTENDED_TERM) `payment.finishedAt` is required.
Cash-on-delivery orders (CASH_ON_DELIVERY) are imported — payment happens on delivery.

## Integration configuration (form in the app)

- `clientId` / `clientSecret` — an application from https://apps.developer.allegro.pl
- `refreshToken` — one-time bootstrap: `./scripts/allegro-device-auth.sh <clientId> <clientSecret>`
  (for production, prefix with `ALLEGRO_OAUTH_BASE=https://allegro.pl/auth/oauth`).
  After saving the form the application refreshes and rotates tokens automatically
  (access 12 h, refresh 3 months).

## Testing on the Allegro Sandbox

1. Create TWO free accounts at https://allegro.pl.allegrosandbox.pl (seller + buyer);
   fictional data is fine, the 2FA SMS code is always 123456. On the seller account fill in
   the company data and sales settings in the Sales Center.
2. Register an application at https://apps.developer.allegro.pl.allegrosandbox.pl
   (device flow, scope orders read+write) — credentials are separate from production.
3. Seller refresh token: `./scripts/allegro-device-auth.sh <clientId> <clientSecret>`.
   The client secret can also be provided via the `ALLEGRO_CLIENT_SECRET` environment
   variable (the script uses it as a fallback for `$2`), keeping it out of shell history
   and `ps` output.
4. List an offer as the seller (sandbox UI), buy it as the buyer and PAY for it in the
   payment simulator (payments-simulator.allegrosandbox.pl — choose a successful payment).
   The order transitions to READY_FOR_PROCESSING.
5. Smoke test:
   `ALLEGRO_CLIENT_ID=... ALLEGRO_CLIENT_SECRET=... ALLEGRO_REFRESH_TOKEN=... \
    mvn test -Dtest=AllegroSandboxSmokeTest -Dallegro.sandbox.smoke=true`

   Note: Allegro rotates refresh tokens — the smoke test's token refresh invalidates the
   token you exported. Run a fresh device-flow (step 3) to obtain a new refresh token before
   pasting it into the app form in step 6; a consumed token pasted into the form will
   immediately mark the connection as lost.
6. E2E in the application: run the app with
   `-DALLEGRO_API_URL=https://api.allegro.pl.allegrosandbox.pl`
   `-DALLEGRO_TOKEN_URL=https://allegro.pl.allegrosandbox.pl/auth/oauth/token`,
   connect the Allegro integration in the store settings and paste the refresh token.
   Note: the import listener (`MarketplaceOrdersImportEventListener`) runs only with
   `application.env=prod` — locally the import is verified by the smoke test.

Sandbox limitations: the payment simulator does not allow changing the amount (no over/underpayment
tests), it can be unstable (504s), and account activation can be delayed.
